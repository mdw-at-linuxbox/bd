# About

This is an Ansible Playbook to deploy data lab environments with any number of
tools commonly used by by data driven organizations. The purpose of the playbook
is to accelerate the deployment of data labs, enforcing consistency across labs,
for functional and performance testing.

Post deploy, the following software will be available inside the data lab:

* Hadoop 2.7.3
* Spark 2.1.1
* Hive 2.2.1
* Presto 0.177

# Dependencies

Red Hat enterprise 7 or centos 7.

# Provision Data Lab on AWS EC2

The easiest way to experiment with this playbook and familiarize yourself with
the data lab it creates is to leverage Amazon EC2.  This script installs
awscli and python2-boto3 for that purpose.

In order to be able to access the data lab you will need to provide some
information in the form of variables. These variables are defined by editing
the ``vars/ec2.yml`` file, notably:

   - ``my_ip`` : Add public ip address of your workstation
   - ``ec2_keypair`` : Add your EC2 keypair name

You will also need to export your **AWS_ACCESS_KEY** and **AWS_SECRET_KEY** as
environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='Your_AWS_Access_Key_Here'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='Your_AWS_Secret_Key_Here'
```

With the ansible and environmental variables set, you can instruct Ansible to
boot your data lab by executing the ``boot.yml`` play:

```ansible-playbook -i hosts boot.yml```

If you want to avoid having to accept host keys, you can use an environmental
variable to tell Ansible not to check host SSH keys:

```export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False```

After the data lab is booted, verify ansible can reach all hosts:

```ansible -i ec2.py -u ec2-user -m ping all```

Once you have verified that all hosts are reachable, you can execute the site
play:

```ansible-playbook -i ec2.py site.yml```

# Provision Data Lab on Bare Metal

If you decide to deploy to bare metal servers, the current assumption is that
they are provisioned running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7.

When you deploy to bare metal, you need to specify which group a particular
node will assume in an Ansible inventory file. There are two main host groups
for this playbook, with an example inventory named ``hosts`` in the root of the
playbook repository.

You should change the deploy_method variable in the ``group_vars/all`` file to
``bare``.

Once you have added your hosts to the inventory file, you can run the site
play:

```ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml```

When it finishes, you should have a complete data lab ready to go!

# Deployed Environment

* master 
* core

The "master" host runs cluster services, and serve as a client bastion to launch
benchmarks from. You should only have one "master" host in your cluster.

* yarn resource manager
* yarn history server
* hdfs namenode
* hive metastore
* presto coordinator

The "core" hosts do the heavy lifting, running map reduce or spark tasks on
yarn, or processing queries on presto workers.

* yarn node manager
* hdfs datanode
* kafka broker
* presto worker
